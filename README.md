# Joint Savings Solidity Assignment

## Introduction
The objective of the assignment was to create a Ethereum compatible joint savings account using a Solidity smart contract. Some basic starter code and guidelines were provided as part of the assignment. The starter code can be found in the "Starter_Code" folder on the main branch.

## Code Disclaimer
Used the starter code as my starting point and added code from there.
While all code is my own, I did research issues I was having online. No code was directly copied, online resources served as inspiration only.
Please see execution screenshots in sub folder.
I was able to deploy and transact. I could see my transactions in Ganache, but they were not appearing in the Remix console. Still unsure as to why. 

## Results
While I ran into problems initially, I was able to create the joint account and transact between the two individual accounts and the joint account. The raw code can be viewed in the joint_savings.sol file on the main branch. Below are screenshots showing the contract deploying and transacting as intended. 

## Future
I need to spend some time to figure out why the transaction were appearing in Ganache but not in the Remix console. Otherwise the asssingment was a success.

## Final Thoughts
Thank you taking the time to look through my assignment!
