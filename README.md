# Joint Savings Solidity Assignment

## Code Disclaimer
Used the starter code as my starting point and added code from there.
While all code is my own, I did research issues I was having online. No code was directly copied, online resources served as inspiration only.
Please see execution screenshots in sub folder.
I was able to deploy and transact. i could see my transactions in Ganache, but they were not appearing in the remix console. Still unsure as to why. 

## Final Thoughts
Thank you for grading my assignment!
